# Socom3-CA-PatchServer

## The Goal of this Project is to Create a "server" that allows for a Ps2 Running Socom 3 US Navy Seals or Socom Combined Assault to download the original game patches from the SCEA server and trick the ps2 into encrypting them with the built in DNAS function.

### This IS NOT a project attempting to revive any Socom Servers. You should probably write SCEA and ask them Nicely for The SCE-RT Sdk and the network middleware that goes along with it.

#### If a method Exists where the games can be patched it could potentially allow for someone who is attempting to create a DME game server to issue a patch to the game that would allow for code that might be needed to make someones potential project work on X console. If all Else fails it could atleast send the final patches sony released to the console 


Socom Us Navy Seals,DNAS,Playstation are all Trademarked and considered the Intellectual Property of SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT.
